# H3N2_Antigenic_Epi
Code and data to reproduce the results and figures in Perofsky _et al._ 2023. "Antigenic drift and subtype interference shape A(H3N2) epidemic dynamics in the United States"

## Abstract

Influenza viruses continually evolve new antigenic variants, through mutations in epitopes of their major surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Antigenic drift potentiates the reinfection of previously infected individuals, but the contribution of this process to variability in annual epidemics is not well understood. Here we link influenza A(H3N2) virus evolution to regional epidemic dynamics in the United States during 1997â€”2019. We integrate phenotypic measures of HA antigenic drift and sequence-based measures of HA and NA fitness to infer antigenic and genetic distances between viruses circulating in successive seasons. We estimate the magnitude, severity, timing, transmission rate, age-specific patterns, and subtype dominance of each regional outbreak and find that genetic distance based on broad sets of epitope sites is the strongest evolutionary predictor of A(H3N2) virus epidemiology. Increased HA and NA epitope distance between seasons correlates with larger, more intense epidemics, higher transmission, greater A(H3N2) subtype dominance, and a greater proportion of cases in adults relative to children, consistent with increased population susceptibility. Based on random forest models, A(H1N1) incidence impacts A(H3N2) epidemics to a greater extent than viral evolution, suggesting that subtype interference is a major driver of influenza A virus infection dynamics, presumably via heterosubtypic cross-immunity.

Data processing and statistical analyses are performed with the statistical computing software [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (version 4.3.0). The phylogenetics workflow can be found at the GitHub repository [blab/perofsky-ili-antigenicity](https://github.com/blab/perofsky-ili-antigenicity). Key outputs from [blab/perofsky-ili-antigenicity](https://github.com/blab/perofsky-ili-antigenicity) are in the _2_Phylo_Dataset_ folder, so it is not necessary to run the phylogenetic analysis before running the code in this repository.


## R scripts are split into 5 chunks:

* _1_Epi_Dataset_ folder
  * `1_cdc_hhs_level_ili_viral_surv_df.R`: Pull and compile CDC FluView data to estimate HHS region type/subtype-specific incidences for seasons 1997-1998 to 2018-2019. Incidences are calculated my multiplying the proportion of outpatient encounters for influenza-like illness (from ILINet) by the proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza A(H3N2), A(H1N1), or B.
  * 2_cdc_virology_surv_interp_smooth_and_onset_estimates.R: Interpolate missing values and smooth incidence time series. Estimate epidemic onsets by fitting piecewise linear models to incidence curves.
  * 3_cdc_ili_burden_metrics_hhs_regions.R: For each region and season, estimate epidemic size, peak incidence, timing (e.g., onset and peak timing, spatiotemporal synchrony), subtype dominance, and age-specific influenza-like-illness (ILI) case patterns.
  * 4_cdc_ili_Rt_hhs_regions.R: Use the [Epidemia R package](https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/epidemia/index.html) to estimate regional A(H3N2) effective reproduction numbers (effective Rt) during each season.

* _2_Phylo_Dataset_ folder
  * "HA_manual" and "NA_manual" scripts (1-9) estimate antigenic and genetic distances between viruses circulating during seasons early in the dataset (1996 - 1998) that are not included in the output of the [phylogenetics workflow](https://github.com/blab/perofsky-ili-antigenicity).
  * 10_LBI_diversity_calcs.R: Calculate the Shannon entropy of HA and NA local branching index values during each season.
  * Folder _auspice_tables_: Sequence-level evolutionary fitness measurements.
  * Folder _distance_tables_: Seasonal measures of antigenic and genetic distance between viruses circulating in successive seasons.

* _3_Epi_Antigenic_Univariate_Analyses_ folder
  * 1_make_ili_and_antigenic_dataset.R: Combine seasonal epidemic metrics and A(H3N2) evolutionary indicators into one dataset.
  * 2_ILI_subtype_time_series_fig1.R: Make Figure 1 showing regional influenza type and subtype specific incidences from 1997 to 2019.
  * 3_predictors_H3_subtype_dom.R: Associations between A(H3N2) viral evolution and A(H3N2) subtype dominance.
  * 4_predictors_H3_epi_metrics.R: Associations between A(H3N2) viral evolution and A(H3N2) epidemic size, peak incidence, epidemic intensity (inverse Shannon entropy of the incidence distribution), and transmissibility.
  * 5_predictors_H3_age_prop.R: Associations between A(H3N2) viral evolution and age-specific ILI case patterns.
  * 6_predictors_H3_epi_timing.R: Associations between A(H3N2) viral evolution and A(H3N2) epidemic onset and peak timing, epidemic speed (seasonal duration, days from onset to peak), and spatiotemporal synchrony.
  * 7_h3_epi_metrics_vs_h1_and_b.R: Associations between A(H3N2) epidemic metrics and A(H1N1) and B epidemic size.
  * 8_evol_indicators_scatterplot.R: Pairwise correlations between A(H3N2) evolutionary indicators.
  * 9_epi_indicators_scatterplot.R: Pairwise correlations between A(H3N2) epidemic metrics.

* _4_Wavelet_Analysis_ folder
  * h3_vs_h1_wavelet_coherence.R: Supplementary wavelet analysis that compares the relative timing of influenza A(H3N2), A(H1N1), and B epidemics each season. This main script sources functions in WaveletPkg.R located in the _Wavelets_ subfolder.

* _5_Variable_Selection_Analyses_ folder
  * Scripts 1-5 run conditional inference random forest models and LASSO regression models predicting A(H3N2) epidemic metrics in each region and season, including peak incidence, epidemic size, epidemic intensity, effective Rt, and subtype dominance. Model features include viral evolutionary indicators, co-circulation of other influenza types/subtypes, proxies for prior immunity, and vaccine-related parameters.
  * 6_top_features_regression_model.R: Extract the top 10 ranked predictors from random forest models and use model selection (BIC) to determine the best fit "minimal" linear regression model, allowing each candidate model to include up to 3 covariates.
  * 7_variable_importance_plots.R: Plot variable importance rankings from random forest and LASSO models. Plot observed versus predicted values for each region/season from random forest models and estimate seasonal RMSE of random forest predictions.
